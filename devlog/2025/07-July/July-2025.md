## Day 2: Wednesday 30 July 2025 - Hobart, Tasmania
### Completed Tasks

- Built a double-confirmation subscription Brevo form and installed it in the blog. Tested it with three emails. Sending to my personal Gmail was fine but my Outlook address sent the first email to the Junk folder.
- Built an additional double-confirmation subscription page within the base website.  
- Changed all hyperlinks (I think) to the subscription page to point to the base website.
### Link(s) to Work
1. [Newsletter subscription form](https://brendangasparin.com/newsletter/).
### Thoughts

I'm starting this dev log today. (I retroactively filled in yesterday's activity, because that's when I officially started Project: COMPENDIA.)

I'm calling this Project: COMPENDIA because I plan on making compendiums related to technology, computers, and programming. Digital compendiums, i.e. online courses.

I'm working on an existing technology stack of Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP, with a WordPress blog within the main website.

My plan is to add a second WordPress website (maybe as a subdomain) and install a learning content management system to build a course site within my main site. I will release most of the videos on YouTube but there will be extra stuff inside the courses. I can charge using Stripe or PayPal.

I haven't looked at my website for a few months. Possibly since April. I had to get used to the structure of the website and the way that WordPress works all over again.

My priority today was to set up an email list. I've decided to use Brevo, because it seems pretty advanced and has up to 300 emails per day on the free plan. So today I put the contact form together and tested it with my own email addresses.
