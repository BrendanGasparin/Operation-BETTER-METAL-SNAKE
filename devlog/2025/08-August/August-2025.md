The links at the bottom of my Medium articles still point to the old, broken URLs, despite the fact that the canonical links in the source code are now correct. I should implement URL redirects in Apache to point the old article URLs to the new articles.

There's not much time left in the week and I still have to proofread and write the final draft of a blog entry. I have written two documents, each about 1000 words, that I can choose for my returning blog post.  I believe I'll choose the simpler one, an article about the basics of computers.

- Fixed meta og and twitter tag URLs on all pages of the base website. They were pointed at GitHub.

Initially I thought I'd call this Project: COMPENDIA because it's essentially an effort to create digital compendia on a website. But the way I envisioned it originally, Project: MATRIX CORE was the creation of my website.

That project, MATRIX CORE, is still not complete. I've dragged my feet for months on getting some nice photos for the home page and About page. They just have duplicate photos of me outside the Sydney Opera House over and over gain. And I could use more entry points for my email list.

So the effort to get the website up and running again as a blog and a place to sell my web development services was Project: MATRIX CORE. I no longer wish to sell my web development services though. I do not have it in me to cold call businesses. I do not even know if I have it in me to cold email businesses.

Instead I'm making this course website. So Project: MATRIX CORE ends when the website is up and running enough that I'm not embarrassed by it.

Then Project: COMPENDIA begins: the actual creation of the course site within my main website (or as a subdomain).

Here are all the things I think I could possibly do to finish MATRIX CORE and get into COMPENDIA once and for all:
#### Project: MATRIX CORE To-Do List
- UX test more beta users with the signup form.  
- Update photos in Home page and About page.
- Add signup form to the Home page.
- Add signup form to the Blog page.
- Add signup form at the bottom of blog posts?  
- Do I need to do anything GDPR related for UK users, or is that just for UK websites?  
- Do something with the consultation stuff? Get rid of it? Make the CTA my newsletter?

Of course, there's nothing stopping me from starting COMPENDIA now, or tomorrow, if I want to. But it would be nice to have a presentable main website in case it starts getting hits. I am curious about how LearnDash works though.

I've recorded footage for a YouTube vlog every day but Sunday in the last week. I uploaded my second vlog at midnight on Saturday night. It's a bit embarrassing. Whatever.

Come to think of it, this is more complicated than just Project: MATRIX CORE and Project: COMPENDIA. I'm also trying to run a YouTube channel and post to multiple social media channels. I might think of other ways to generate income beside a course.

I think I should call this whole endeavor Operation: BETTER METAL SNAKE.

A tribute to my failed cybersecurity Project: METAL SNAKE, and a second tribute to an awesome Dethklok song.

The website creation, the course creation, the marketing the YouTube, the social media: it's all Operation: BETTER METAL SNAKE. Always has been.

**BETTER METAL SNAKE** is life.
