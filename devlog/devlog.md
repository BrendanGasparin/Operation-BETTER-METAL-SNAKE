# Developer Log
## Day 7: Monday 4 August 2025 - Hobart, Tasmania
### Completed Tasks
- Beta-tested the newsletter submit form on my Mum and modified the UI accordingly.
- Finished the blog post. It's called Seven Reasons to Learn the C Programming Language. I will upload it on the weekend.
- Fixed meta og and twitter tag URLs on all pages of the base website. They were pointed at GitHub.
### Thoughts
1500 hours
Initially I thought I'd call this Project: COMPENDIA because it's essentially an effort to create digital compendia on a website. But the way I envisioned it originally, Project: MATRIX CORE was the creation of my website.

That project, MATRIX CORE, is still not complete. I've dragged my feet for months on getting some nice photos for the home page and About page. They just have duplicate photos of me outside the Sydney Opera House over and over gain. And I could use more entry points for my email list.

So the effort to get the website up and running again as a blog and a place to sell my web development services was Project: MATRIX CORE. I no longer wish to sell my web development services though. I do not have it in me to cold call businesses. I do not even know if I have it in me to cold email businesses.

Instead I'm making this course website. So Project: MATRIX CORE ends when the website is up and running enough that I'm not embarrassed by it.

Then Project: COMPENDIA begins: the actual creation of the course site within my main website (or as a subdomain).

Here are all the things I think I could possibly do to finish MATRIX CORE and get into COMPENDIA once and for all:
### Project: MATRIX CORE To-Do List
- UX test more beta users with the signup form.  
- Update photos in Home page and About page.
- Add signup form to the Home page.
- Add signup form to the Blog page.
- Add signup form at the bottom of blog posts?  
- Do I need to do anything GDPR related for UK users, or is that just for UK websites?  
- Do something with the consultation stuff? Get rid of it? Make the CTA my newsletter?

Of course, there's nothing stopping me from starting COMPENDIA now, or tomorrow, if I want to. But it would be nice to have a presentable main website in case it starts getting hits. I am curious about how LearnDash works though.

I've recorded footage for a YouTube vlog every day but Sunday in the last week. I uploaded my second vlog at midnight on Saturday night. It's a bit embarrassing. Whatever.

Come to think of it, this is more complicated than just Project: MATRIX CORE and Project: COMPENDIA. I'm also trying to run a YouTube channel and post to multiple social media channels. I might think of other ways to generate income beside a course.

I think I should call this whole endeavor Operation: BETTER METAL SNAKE.

A tribute to my failed cybersecurity Project: METAL SNAKE, and a second tribute to an awesome Dethklok song.

The website creation, the course creation, the marketing the YouTube, the social media: it's all Operation: BETTER METAL SNAKE. Always has been.

BETTER METAL SNAKE is life.

## Day 2: Wednesday 30 July 2025 - Hobart, Tasmania
### Completed Tasks

- Built a double-confirmation subscription Brevo form and installed it in the blog. Tested it with three emails. Sending to my personal Gmail was fine but my Outlook address sent the first email to the Junk folder.
- Built an additional double-confirmation subscription page within the base website.  
- Changed all hyperlinks (I think) to the subscription page to point to the base website.
### Thoughts

I'm starting this dev log today. (I retroactively filled in yesterday's activity, because that's when I officially started Project: COMPENDIA.)

I'm calling this Project: COMPENDIA because I plan on making compendiums related to technology, computers, and programming. Digital compendiums, i.e. online courses.

I'm working on an existing technology stack of Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP, with a WordPress blog within the main website.

My plan is to add a second WordPress website (maybe as a subdomain) and install a learning content management system to build a course site within my main site. I will release most of the videos on YouTube but there will be extra stuff inside the courses. I can charge using Stripe or PayPal.

I haven't looked at my website for a few months. Possibly since April. I had to get used to the structure of the website and the way that WordPress works all over again.

My priority today was to set up an email list. I've decided to use Brevo, because it seems pretty advanced and has up to 300 emails per day on the free plan. So today I put the contact form together and tested it with my own email addresses.

## Day 1: Tuesday 29 July 2025 - Hobart, Tasmania

### Completed Tasks

- Set up Brevo to work with my business email address.
- Recorded an intro to the week for the [YouTube vlog](https://youtube.com/BrendanGasparin/).
